Stock Data Analysis

The Stock Data Analysis program is a Python application that allows users to analyze stock data for selected companies. It provides functionality to download stock data, visualize price and volume variations, calculate statistics, and display the results in a graphical user interface (GUI).

Purpose
The purpose of this program is to assist users in analyzing and understanding the stock market trends for specific companies. By providing visualizations, statistical analysis, and key insights, the program helps users make informed decisions regarding investments and track the performance of their selected companies.

Functionality
The program offers the following main features:

*Company Selection: Users can select one or more companies to analyze from the available options (e.g., Microsoft and Apple).

*Data Processing: The program downloads historical stock data for the selected companies within a specified date range. The data is then processed and cleaned for further analysis.

*Graphical Visualization: The program generates interactive graphs that visualize the stock price and volume variations over the selected date range. Users can explore the graphs, zoom in/out, and view specific data points.

*Statistical Analysis: The program calculates statistical measures such as the mean, median, and standard deviation of the stock prices and volumes for the selected companies. These statistics provide insights into the overall trends and volatility of the stocks.

*Result Display: The program displays the calculated statistics and analysis results in a clear and organized format within the GUI. Users can easily interpret and interpret the information.

*User-Friendly Interface: The GUI provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the program. It includes options to select companies, specify date ranges, and trigger data analysis and visualizations.


To run the Stock Data Analysis program, follow these steps:
- make sure you have Python 3
- make sure that this dependencies are installed:
      pip install tkcalendar matplotlib pandas

-Run the program by executing the following command:
      python gui.py
      
-The GUI window will appear, allowing you to interact with the program and perform stock data analysis.

Dependencies
The program relies on the following dependencies:
-tkcalendar: A Python library for creating date entry widgets in the GUI.
-matplotlib: A plotting library for generating graphs and visualizations.
-pandas: A data manipulation library for processing and analyzing the stock data.

Make sure to install these dependencies before running the program.

Examples of Program Usage:
1)Select Companies: Choose one or more companies (e.g., Microsoft and Apple) by checking the corresponding checkboxes.

2)Specify Date Range: Enter the start and end dates for the analysis period using the date entry fields.

3)Process Data: Click the "Process Data" button to download and process the stock data for the selected companies and date range.

4)Visualize Price Variations: The program will generate a graph showing the variations in stock prices for the selected companies over time. You can explore the graph, zoom in/out, and view specific data points.

5)Perform Volume Analysis: Click the "Perform Volume Analysis" button to analyze the volume variations for the selected companies. A new graph will be displayed, showing the volume trends over time.

6)View Results and Statistics: The program will display the calculated statistics, such as the average closing price and average volume, for each selected company. These results provide insights into the performance and volatility of the stocks.

7)Further Analysis: You can adjust the date range, select different companies, and reprocess the data to perform additional analysis and explore different trends.
